# Introduction

This is a Project on Airplane Crashes and Fatalities Since 1918. Insight was gotten from the dashboard using using different visuals.

# Problem Statement
![Statement](https://github.com/Mr-Art-coder/Aircrashes-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Problem%20Statement.png)

In the 30Daysoflearning course organized by Microsoft, a dataset was given which consists of data on airplane crashes and fatalities since 1918 with the task to tell a visual story from this Data. The motive behind this project is to analyze and visualize some key details about the perilous crashes which seized the lives of people, to find out the highest fatality rate, the operator involved, the date, time numbers of people aboard during the fatality, and the number of people who escaped death.
After a critical examination of the dataset, I was able to come out with the following questions which were later visualized: 
-	What is the totality of people onboard in all the crashes?
-	What is the totality of the people who were aboard and went with the crashes?
-	What is the totality of the people who were not aboard but were killed on the ground during the crashes?
-	Has anybody escaped death before?
-	How many locations and operators are in the data?
-	Which operator has the highest record of crashes
-	Where was the location where the major crash occurred, and what time and year did major crashes occur?

All these questions were answered after a thorough analysis and visualization of the data

# Data Sourcing

The data was cloned from the 30daysoflearning GitHub repository which was originally gotten from Kaggle website. The data which is in CSV format consists of a dimension table that contains all the information needed.

----

# Data Transformation


The data contains 13 columns which include, Date, Time, Location, Operator, Flight, Route, Type, Registration, Cn/in, Aboard, Fatalities, Ground, and Summary.
The transformation started by using the first row as a header, then # was removed from the spelling of Flight and Cn/in was changed to Serial Number for easy understanding of the data.
In the flight column, all â€“ values were removed. A new column was added, for example, this was achieved by inserting day, month, and year from the Date column. Also, to find the number of people who escaped the crashes, a new column was added named Escaped.

----

# Visualization
Different visuals were used in the project, cards, line chart, stacked chart, Table, etc. were used to analyze and visualize in the Operator page whiletreemaprd, tree map, line, and clustered column chart, and stacked bar chart were used to analyze and visualize in the Location page

# Findings 
![Dashboard](https://github.com/Mr-Art-coder/Aircrashes-Data-Visualization/blob/main/Dashboard.JPG)

The first crash happened on Thursday, 5 1918 in the USA at Dayton-McCook Filed Ohio which was 10km away from the Airport, it happened due to technical failure, and it led to the death of two occupants of the plane. The highest record of fatality record where 4636 was recorded in 737 crashes.

The first crash in Nigeria occurred at Portharcourt on May 22, 1937, it was caused because the airplane engine stalled and crashed short of runaway, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and all five occupants were injured.
